# Prime Number Finder
This is an Android app that I made to help me learn Java and Android application development. I have been continually adding new features and improving old ones as I get new ideas. This app is published on the Play Store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tycho.app.primenumberfinder) and is completely free to use and does not contain any ads!
